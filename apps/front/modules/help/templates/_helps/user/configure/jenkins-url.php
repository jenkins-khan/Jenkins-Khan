<h2>Jenkins URL</h2>

<p>
  URL of the Jenkins you want to use.<br />
  Something like
  <pre>http://localhost:8080</pre>
</p>

<h3>If jenkins's security is enabled</h3>

<p>
  If your jenkins needs credentials you need to put your
  jenkins user and token api before the hostname.<br />
  So you should indicate an URL like this :
  <pre>http://user:token@ci.mydomain.org:8080</pre>
  More information about this could be found on <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API">Jenkins wiki</a>.
